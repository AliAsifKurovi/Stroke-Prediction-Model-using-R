## Build and deploy a stroke prediction model using R

# Overview of My Stroke Prediction Model Project
I undertook a project to build and deploy a stroke prediction model using R, focusing on several key steps:

# 1. Data Import and Preprocessing:
* Installed and loaded necessary R packages and libraries.
* Loaded the stroke dataset.
* Conducted an exploratory data analysis (EDA) to understand the dataset, including summary statistics and initial data exploration.
* Visualized key features to understand their distributions and relationships.
* Preprocessed the data by handling missing values, converting categorical variables to factors, and normalizing numeric features.
* Addressed class imbalance by using oversampling with the ROSE package.

# 2. Data Visualization:
* Created various plots to visualize the distribution of features like age, BMI, and average glucose level.
* Analyzed the relationships between features and the target variable (stroke).

# 3. Correlation Analysis:
* Computed and visualized the correlation matrix to understand how features relate to each other.

# 4. Data Splitting:
* Split the data into training and testing sets to ensure unbiased model evaluation.

# 5. Model Building:
* Built a logistic regression model to predict stroke.
* Made predictions on the test set.

# 6. Model Evaluation:
* Evaluated the model using a confusion matrix and calculated sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy.
* Performed 5-fold cross-validation to assess the model's performance.


## Strengths of My Approach
* Comprehensive EDA: I performed thorough exploratory data analysis to understand the data and identify potential issues.
* Handling Missing Values: I addressed missing values in the dataset to ensure data quality.
* Class Imbalance: I tackled class imbalance using the ROSE package to build a robust model.
* Visualization: I effectively used visualizations to explore data distributions and relationships.
* Model Evaluation: I evaluated the model using multiple metrics and cross-validation, providing a well-rounded assessment of its performance.

# Conclusions
# 1. Data Quality and Insights:
* My EDA and visualizations provided valuable insights into the data, such as the distribution of age, BMI, and glucose levels among stroke and non-stroke patients.
* By handling missing values and class imbalance, I ensured the dataset was well-prepared for modeling.

# 2.Model Performance:
* The logistic regression model's performance can be assessed using sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy. If these metrics are satisfactory, it indicates a reliable model for stroke prediction.
* Cross-validation results give an indication of the model's generalizability and robustness.

# 3. Areas for Improvement:
* I plan to try other machine learning algorithms (e.g., Random Forest, SVM, Gradient Boosting) to potentially improve prediction accuracy.
* I will explore feature engineering to create new features that might enhance model performance.
* I intend to tune hyperparameters of the models to optimize their performance further.

# Worth of My Work
* Academic Value: This project demonstrates a solid understanding of data analysis, preprocessing, and model building, making it valuable in an academic or learning context.
* Professional Application: The approach and techniques used are applicable in real-world data science projects, making this work relevant for professional purposes.
* Improvement and Exploration: This methodology provides a foundation that can be expanded with more advanced techniques, making it a good starting point for further exploration.

This project showcases a thorough approach to building and deploying a predictive model. It is valuable both academically and professionally, and with some enhancements, it can lead to even better predictive performance.
